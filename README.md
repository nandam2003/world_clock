# world_clock

An World clock app

## Getting Started

We can use this app to know the time in different places in the world with the help of online [Api](https://www.timeapi.io/swagger/index.html) 

It brings data from the Api through http request and parsing the recieved Json into dart class to further use the data in the app.
